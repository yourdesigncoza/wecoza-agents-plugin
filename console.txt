## It seems most of the console errors are due to the fact that we are loading scripts meant for the agent-capture shortcode on the agent-display shortcode page. We should conditionally load these scripts only on the pages when `wecoza_capture_agents` shortcode is used.

Reference these articles for possible solution:
